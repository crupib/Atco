How to construct a Toolbar using PBForms to create the foundation code.
=======================================================================

1. Create a dialog with the following styles:

    %WS_POPUP
    %WS_BORDER
    %WS_DLGFRAME
    %WS_THICKFRAME
    %WS_CAPTION
    %WS_SYSMENU
    %WS_MINIMIZEBOX
    %WS_MAXIMIZEBOX
    %WS_CLIPSIBLINGS
    %DS_CENTER

2. Add a custom control to the dialog, and position at the top of the dialog,
   25 dialog units high, and as wide as the dialog. Note the absolute size of
   the control is not important, as it is resized and located automatically at
   runtime.

3. Set the Class Name of the custom control to "ToolbarWindow32" (without the
   quotes). Do not set any primary styles.

4. Add menus if required.

5. Save the project and open it the IDE.

6. Just below the #PBForms End Includes line, add the following lines:

    #INCLUDE "CommCtrl.inc"
    #INCLUDE "PBForms.inc"

7. Below the #PBForms End Constants line, define the following equates:

    %ToolButtons = 9
    %ID_Btn1     = 1001
    %ID_Btn2     = 1002
    %ID_Btn3     = 1003
    %ID_Btn4     = 1004
    %ID_Btn5     = 1005
    %ID_Btn6     = 1006
    %IDR_IMGFILE2 = 104

8. Below the #PBForms Declarations line, add the following declare:

    DECLARE FUNCTION SetToolbarButtons (BYVAL hDlg AS DWORD) AS LONG

9. Add the following line of code into PBMAIN, before the ShowDIALOG1 call:

    PBFormsInitComCtls(%ICC_WIN95_CLASSES)

10. In the ShowDIALOG1Proc function, add the following handlers:

    CASE %WM_INITDIALOG
        ' Force TB to initially resize before we display the dialog
        DIALOG POST CBHNDL, %WM_SIZE, 0, 0

    CASE %WM_SIZE
        ' Resize the status bar as the dialog is resized
        CONTROL POST CBHNDL, %IDC_TOOLBAR, CBMSG, 0, 0
        FUNCTION = 1

11. Set the Primary and Extended styles for the toolbar custom control as
    follows:

    %WS_CHILD OR %WS_VISIBLE OR %WS_BORDER OR %CCS_TOP OR _
    %TBSTYLE_TOOLTIPS OR %TB_AUTOSIZE, %WS_EX_LEFT OR _
    %WS_EX_LTRREADING OR %WS_EX_RIGHTSCROLLBAR

12. Just below the #PBForms End Dialog statement, add the following line:

    CALL SetToolbarButtons(hDlg)

13. Finally, append the SetToolbarButtons function as shown in the example,
    and save the file.

14. Open the ToolBar.rc file in the IDE. Immediately below the line
    #define IDR_IMGFILE1 103
    add the following line:

    #define IDR_IMGFILE2 104

15. Just below the line that reads
    IDR_IMGFILE1 ICON DISCARDABLE "APPICON.ICO"
    add the following line:

    IDR_IMGFILE2    BITMAP DISCARDABLE "TOOLBAR.BMP"

16. Save the RC file and compile it. Switch back to the Toolbar.bas file and
    run it!
