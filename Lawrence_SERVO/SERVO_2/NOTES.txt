This PIC dual servo has been very successful. 

I have:
- a working prototype board using the dspic33fj128202 28 pin chip

- a working dual channel power amplifier based on the LMD18200 chip

- 2 axis of servos with full PID-FF positioning loops,

- 2 axis serial command interface for setting up and controlling both axis

- 2 channels of offset/pc position control via quadrature signalling 

- 4 channels of analog I/O 

- 2 quadrature encoder interfaces

- serial commands for both raw velocity and raw PWM output

- a trapezoidal motion profile command via the serial port

- non volatile parameter storage in the code space (dspic33 does not have eeprom memory)

- 28% of the code space is used and 12% of the ram memory space is used... 
  this leaves lots of room for program additions as may be required in final application.

- screenshot-1.png shows the tuning parameters available for each axis.

- screenshot-2.png shows a diagnostic screen showing servo status

This code is stable, complete, and well tested and ready for use as is or add more features.
