'
'  LIBMAIN function Purpose:
'
'    User-defined function called by Windows each time a DLL is loaded into,
'    and unloaded from, memory. In 32-bit Windows, LibMain is called each
'    time a DLL is loaded by an application or process.  Your code should
'    never call LibMain explicitly.
'
'    hInstance is the DLL instance handle.  This handle is used by the
'    calling application to identify the DLL being called.  To access
'    resources in the DLL, this handle will need to be stored in a global
'    variable.  Use the GetModuleHandle(BYVAL 0&) to get the instance
'    handle of the calling EXE.
'
'    fdwReason specifies a flag indicating why the DLL entry-point
'    (LibMain) is being called by Windows.
'
'    lpvReserved specifies further aspects of the DLL initialization
'    and cleanup.  If fdwReason is %DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, lpvReserved is
'    NULL (zero) for dynamic loads and non-NULL for static loads.  If
'    fdwReason is %DLL_PROCESS_DETACH, lpvReserved is NULL if LibMain
'    has been called by using the FreeLibrary API call and non-NULL if
'    LibMain has been called during process termination.
'
' Return
'
'    If LibMain is called with %DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, your LibMain function
'    should return a zero (0) if any part of your initialization process
'    fails or a one (1) if no errors were encountered.  If a zero is
'    returned, Windows will abort and unload the DLL from memory. When
'    LibMain is called with any other value than %DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, the
'    return value is ignored.
